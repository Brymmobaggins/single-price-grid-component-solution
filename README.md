# front-end mentor - Single price grid challenge


## Continued development

so far, I  built the desktop design of the challenge, definately would work all mobile view and responsiveness in the various sizes

## what I learned

```html
 <small>I am proud of this</small>, '&dollar' sign, which was helpful in the project.
 ```css
  I learned how to use the "font-family: tahoma", how to style a "sign up" button and add box shadow,
  ```
